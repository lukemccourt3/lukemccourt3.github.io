  <h1>Luke McCourt's Personal Website!</h1>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I am currently a sophomore enrolled at UW-Madison. I created this website for my LIS351 class. I'm originally from Los Angeles California. I like to spend my time on the lake and hanging out my friends. I enjoy watching sports and movies and I'm always listening to music. You can find out in more detail all about these things.</p>

  <h2>What's my favorite thing about Madison?</h2>
    <p>My favorite thing about coming to Madison and going to school here is the change in seasons. Coming from Los Angeles I never experience the change in seasons and usually live in constant warm weather. Although it's extremely cold here I enjoy the snow and actually being able to notice a difference in the months. </p>

  <h2>What information can you find on this website?</h2>
    <p>In essence, this website is all about me and my favorite things! On this website, you can find information about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>movies I like</li>
      <li>music I listen to</li>
      <li>sports teams I follow</li>
    </ul>

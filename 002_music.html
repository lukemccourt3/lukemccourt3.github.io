  <h1>My Favorite Music Genres</h1>

  <h2>1 - Rap </h2>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoy rap music. I grew up listening to a lot of rap music such as Lil Wayne, Run DMC, Outkast, and a lot more. However, my favorite rapper of all time is Young Thug because of his lyrics and the way his voice sounds. He can rap at multiple different pitches and speeds and is one of the higher regarded rappers of today. A couple great songs by him are "Just Might Be," "Just How It Is," and "Worth It." Some of my other favorite current rappers are Kid Cudi and Lil Baby. I listen to a lot of rappers from Atlanta and Chicago.</p>

  <h2>2 - Classic Rock</h2>
    <p>Completely contrasting the previous music genre I really enjoy listening to classic rock and just oldies in general. I listen to a lot of older artists like Creedence Clear Water Revival, Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead. I personally think Jerry Garcia is a musical genius and a top three song writer. Some of my favorite songs are "Hurricane" by Bob Dylan, "Scarlet Begonias" by The Grateful Dead, and "Brandy" by Looking Glass. I also find myself sometimes listening to songs back to the 1950s such as "Runaround Sue" by Dion & the Belmonts.</p>

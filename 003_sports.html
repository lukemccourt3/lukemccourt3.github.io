  <h1>My Favorite Sports Teams</h1>

  <h2>1 - Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California so naturally I am an extremely huge Lakers fan. My parents had tickets when they used to play at the forum and I have been to numerous games throughout my life. I luckily was able to get to see Kobe and Shaq play together live, however, I was pretty young so I only remember bits and pieces. However, I vividly remember seeing Kobe win his fifth and final championship. Kobe Bryant is by far my favorite basketball player of all time because of his incredible drive and work ethic. He is also a five time champion and two time MVP in the NBA. Also the Lakers just won the 2020 championship and I could not be happier.

  <h2>2 - Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
    <p>I can see how one would be confused how I can be a Lakers fan and also a Chiefs fan. However, my entire family was born and raised in Kansas except for my siblings and I. I have grown up watching the Chiefs sine I was little and have not been a fan of any other team, especially because when I was little the rams were in St. Louis. When people hear I'm a Chiefs fan they immediately call me a bandwagon and I have to further explain myself. They don't understand I had to watch Alex Smith almost give me a hope at a playoff spot for multiple years in a row. Luckily with the addition of Patrick Mahomes to our roster we have been on a nonstop win streak. The Chiefs won the Super Bowl last year and I am hoping they can take home Super Bowl LV.</p>
